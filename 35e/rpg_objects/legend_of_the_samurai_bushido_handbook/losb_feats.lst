Aikijutsu											TYPE:General.MAS.MASUnarmed																																					DESC:You are skilled in the art (jutsu) of harmonious (ai) energy (ki). Aikijutsu is a school of unarmed combat that calls for the combatant to integrate his combat strategy with his opponent's. Thus, the actions of a master of Aikijutsu can never be anticipated, since he has no plan going into a battle other than to analyze his opponent for weakness and then exploit that weakness.																																																																																																																																																	CSKILL:Knowledge (Tactics ~ Shusai)|Sense Motive	SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Bojutsu											TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Proficiency (Spears and Staves)																								DESC:Among the oldest weapons invented by man, staves provide a means for both attack and defense while appearing relatively innocuous. Monks and priests greatly favor this weapon, since it allows them to defend themselves while maintaining a passive posture. In times when the use of weapons among the peasant classes is prohibited, the staff also sees a great rise in popularity.																																																																																																																BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT.BoStaff|1																														CSKILL:Balance|Sense Motive
Genkotsu											TYPE:General.MAS.MASUnarmed																																					DESC:You are skilled in the esoteric art of spitting needles out of your mouth.

Hojojutsu											TYPE:General.MAS																															SA:+10 bonus on Use Rope checks to bind a foe	DESC:You are skilled at the use of ropes to immobilize your enemies. This skill was prized by samurai who wanted to take an opponent prisoner (usually at the command of a superior). Ninja were also highly skilled in this art.																																																																																																																																																																												CSKILL:Escape Artist|Use Rope					SOURCEPAGE:p.45
Iaijutsu											TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Quick Draw,Weapon Proficiency (Swords)										PRESTAT:1,DEX=13												DESC:Iaijutsu is the art of drawing and attacking in a single motion. Since the first strike in a duel between swordsmen was often the deciding blow, this art was considered by many samurai to be the most powerful in the arsenal of the swordmaster. The fact that many attacks came unexpected was also a critical reality that spurred the development of this art.																																																																																																																			BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|4|PREEQUIP:1,TYPE=Sword																											CSKILL:Sense Motive						SOURCEPAGE:p.45
Jobajutsu											TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Mounted Combat									PRESKILL:1,Ride=3																	DESC:Like most martial cultures, the Japanese understood the value of cavalry forces in combat. Their horses were smaller on average that European horses but extremely fast, maneuverable and spirited. Controlling such hot-tempered mounts required specialized training and many samurai studied Jobajutsu, the art of military horsemanship elevated to a martial science.																																																																																																																		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=Dodge|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																											CSKILL:Handle Animal|Ride					SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Jodo												TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Proficiency (Spears and Staves)										PRESTAT:1,WIS=13												DESC:This is a more philosophical rendition of Jojutsu.																																																																																																																																																																						BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|WIS|PREEQUIP:1,TYPE=Jo																											CSKILL:Concentration|Pressure Points			SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Jojutsu											TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Proficiency (Spears and Staves)																								DESC:The shorter jo staff seems to lack many of the advantages of its larger counterpart, the bo. While longer staves provide reach and the ability to block attacks from almost any weapon, wielders of the jo staff concentrate on the weapon's speed and accuracy, enabling them to attack with greater accuracy, targeting vulnerable areas of the body with precision strikes.																																																																																																																		BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT.Jo|1|TYPE=Competence	BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|2|PREEQUIP:1,TYPE=Jo																				CSKILL:Balance|Pressure Points				SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Jujutsu											TYPE:General.MAS.MASUnarmed																																					DESC:Like Aikijutsu, Jujutsu represents a defining principle for how the body may be used in combat-in this case, the art (jutsu) of suppleness (ju). By maintaining flexibility (both spiritual and emotional) in combat, the Jujutsu master seeks to overcome his opponent through grapples and projections.																																																																																																																																																															CSKILL:Escape Artist						SOURCEPAGE:p.47
Kenjutsu											TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Proficiency (Swords)																										DESC:You have received training in the art of the sword. In almost all martial cultures, from Western Europe to Japan, the sword has been a symbol of the professional soldier, and in time a symbol of the gentleman. However, it may be said that nowhere else has the sword been raised to the cult status it achieved in Japan. As late as WWII, Japanese soldiers carried katana into battle as much for symbolism as utility (although when combat was reduced to close quarters, their skill with these weapons was shown with deadly effect). Members of the upper crust of all classes, from merchants and artisans to farmers and nobles, wore the single sword as a sign of station (while still remaining within their caste). But the daisho-the twin swords, the katana and the wakizashi-were reserved for the warrior caste alone.																																							BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT.Katana,TOHIT.Wakizashi|1	BONUS:COMBAT|DAMAGE.Katana,DAMAGE.Wakizashi|1																			CSKILL:Balance|Concentration					SOURCEPAGE:p.47
Kumi Uchi				OUTPUTNAME:Kumi-Uchi				TYPE:General.MAS.MASUnarmed																																					DESC:You are trained to use your opponent's armor against him when grappling, while minimizing any disadvantage suffered from your armor. This technique is popular with many soldiers and samurai.																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.47
Kyudo												TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Proficiency (Bows)													PRESTAT:1,WIS=13												DESC:You have received expert training in the way of the bow, an esoteric method of combat that elevates archery to the level of a religious act. It is practiced both on the battlefield and far from it, under the watchful eyes of teachers who are as much spiritual gurus as masters of combat. The Kyudo practitioner believes that if his spirit is true, the path of the arrow is predetermined.																																																																																																																																																CSKILL:Concentration|Pressure Points			SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Kyujutsu											TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Proficiency (Bows)																											DESC:You have received expert training in the art of the bow. A form of warfare highly valued in medieval Japan, the art of the bow became so prestigious that legend links it to the birth of the Japanese nation. The art began as the province of the nobility, but in the warring states period, footsoldiers with archery skills (conscripted from the ranks of the heimin) were highly prized for their ability to launch arrows in massive formations while protected by spearmen (who were also of common birth).																																																																																																																													CSKILL:Balance|Spot						SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Masaki Ryu Manriki Gusari	OUTPUTNAME:Masaki-Ryu Manriki-Gusari	TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Exotic Weapon Proficiency(Chain)																									DESC:This style was developed by the creator of the Manriki-gusari, and is considered the definitive chain art.																																																																																																																																																																																															CSKILL:Balance|Escape Artist					SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Muji Shin Jen Ryu Kendo		OUTPUTNAME:Muji-Shin-Jen-Ryu Kendo		TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Poise,Weapon Proficiency (Swords)						PRESKILL:1,Sense Motive=5	PRESTAT:1,WIS=13												DESC:This style was known as the “sword of no abiding mind” and its founder, Odagiri Sekei, believed the primary aim of swordsmanship was to discipline the swordsman and make him a virtuous man. Odagiri, along with Miyamoto Musashi, was among the first masters of the sword to begin to refer to the art as Kendo rather than Kenjutsu; they asserted that while the practical exigencies of sword use were finite, the spiritual applications of Kendo were infinite.																																																																																																			BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT.Katana,TOHIT.Wakizashi|max(STR,WIS)-STR																									CSKILL:Balance|Concentration					SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Naginatajutsu										TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Proficiency (Spears and Staves)																								DESC:Although the description “Japanese halberd” is often applied to the naginata, this description leads many Westerners to a false impression of the weapon. The halberd is an axe at the end of a long pole and is wielded overhand (with devastating effect), while the naginata is a sword at the end of a long pole and is wielded waist-high like a staff. This art uses the spinning movements of Yarijutsu (from which this art is descended) to even more devastating effect as the naginata master whirls and slashes at his opponent's head, midsection or legs. The art of combat with the naginata was considered beautiful, and among women of the warrior caste proficiency in this art was considered the height of grace and femininity.																																																						BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT.Naginata|max(STR,DEX)-STR																											CSKILL:Balance|Perform (Dance)				SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Ninjutsu											TYPE:General.MAS.MASUnarmed	PRECLASS:1,Ninja=1																																	DESC:You have been trained in the arts of stealth and mystery-the way of the ninja. While many scholars trace the ultimate origins of this art to The Art of War by Sun Tzu and its teachings on espionage, the first definitive date of the ninja arts being used in Japan is almost 1,000 years later, in the 6th century CE.																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Nito Ryu Kenjutsu			OUTPUTNAME:Nito-Ryu Kenjutsu			TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Kenjutsu,Two Weapon Fighting,Weapon Proficiency (Swords)							PRESTAT:1,DEX=15												DESC:You have been trained in the use of katana and wakizashi simultaneously. The legendary Miyamoto Musashi perfected this style of swordsmanship.																																																																																																																																																																																	BONUS:WEAPONPROF=Wakizashi|WIELDCATEGORY|-1										SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Shindo Muso Ryu Jodo		OUTPUTNAME:Shindo Muso-Ryu Jodo		TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Jodo,Two Weapon Fighting,Weapon Proficiency (Spears and Staves)						PRESTAT:1,DEX=15	PRESTAT:1,WIS=13									DESC:This style was invented by the legendary Muso Gunnosuke. After a duel with Miyamoto Musashi in which he was defeated (but his life spared), Gunnosuke retreated to a Shinto shrine where he had an epiphany: a way to defeat the master of two swords. He would fight fire with fire, using twin jo staffs simultaneously. In a return engagement with Musashi, Gunnosuke defeated the master swordsman, but spared his life.																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Shurikenjutsu										TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Proficiency (Ninja)																										DESC:Ninja worked so hard to perfect their technique with this weapon that they developed it into an art all its own. They became so accurate with these weapons that samurai would sometimes study this style, not to learn the use of the shuriken itself but to become more accurate with the thrown tanto.																																																																																																																																																		BONUS:RANGEADD|THROWN|10									CSKILL:Bluff|Sleight of Hand|Spot				SOURCEPAGE:p.50
Suieijutsu											TYPE:General.MAS																									PRESTAT:1,STR=13												DESC:As Japan is an island nation, particularly one with so many rivers and lakes, water plays a huge role in every facet of life, including combat. Because battles often took place near and in rivers and lakes, the art of Suieijutsu (swimming in armor) was developed. Warriors skilled in this art wear special equipment to aid them when crossing or fighting in water, and train rigorously by swimming in their armor and learning how to reduce its encumbrance.																																																																																																																																					CSKILL:Swim								SOURCEPAGE:p.50
Sumo Wrestling										TYPE:General.MAS.MASUnarmed																																					DESC:The first mention of Sumo occurs in the Kojiki, one of the first written works of Japanese history dating from approximately 712 CE (see the section on the Nara Period for more information). However, since the Kojiki was an early attempt at documenting Japan's ancient past, it is arguable (perhaps even likely) that Sumai as sport and warfare is much older. Sumo wrestling is closely linked to the Emperors of Japan. A mythological account of a Sumo match between two giants (one representing the common folk and one the “divine race”) over possession of the island is the source of the royal family's divine right of rule. The Nihongi, another early written work (dating from approximately 720 CE), also mentions a Sumo match fought before Emperor Suinin in which the undefeated Tajima-no-Kehaya met Nomi-no-Sukune. Sukune won the battle by breaking Kehaya's ribs, killing him. When fought as a sport (using nonlethal damage) this art is known as Sumo. When used in combat it is known as Sumai.																																											CSKILL:Balance|Escape Artist					SOURCEPAGE:p.51
Tessenjutsu											TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Exotic Weapon Proficiency(War Fan)																									DESC:Fans were employed for almost every purpose imaginable in medieval Japan: to screen rice and wheat, to referee sumo matches, in theatrical performances, to exchange greetings, to advertise products, and in combat. Tessenjutsu is the art of the war fan, a weapon used to deadly effect by nobles and peasants alike.																																																																																																																																																												CSKILL:Perform (Kabuki ~ Drama)|Sense Motive
Yarijutsu											TYPE:General.MAS							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Proficiency (Spears and Staves)																								DESC:You are skilled in the art of the spear. Bushi of all ranks, from the humblest conscript to the noblest samurai, were practiced with this weapon; rare is the picture of samurai in the medieval period that does not show the warrior carrying or using this weapon. A master of the spear was a whirling dervish of death, and a wise samurai would not approach such a combatant, preferring to use archers to end the threat from afar. Many unwise masters of the katana learned the wisdom of the more cautious warrior only in death.

Many iai-draw exercises place the student in a sitting position (sometimes eating) and teach him to defend himself in that position by blocking an attack without a thought.
