INFOTEXT:It’s the continuation of a tradition started by the Open Gaming License and first brought to you by Necromancer Games in 2002. It’s the First Edition feel that Necromancer Games championed so well by bringing back monsters from the classic days of the game and creating new monsters in the same spirit of old-school resurgence. It’s the combination of the classic Tome of Horrors Revised, Tome of Horrors II, and Tome of Horrors III fully updated to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. It’s 750 full monster stat blocks, 31 templates, 18 hazards, 62 monster-PC options, 18 monster variants, 24 feats, and 8 planes of existence, plus much, more. In short it’s the Tome of Horrors…Complete.
