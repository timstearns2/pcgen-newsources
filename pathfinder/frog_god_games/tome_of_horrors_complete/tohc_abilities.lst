Racial bonuses gained from different deformities are cumulative. For each deformity an aberrant possesses, it gains a -2 racial penalty on Charisma-based checks with non-aberrants except for Intimidate checks, where it instead gains a +2 racial bonus.

Debilitating Constriction	KEY:Abyssal Harvester ~ Debilitating Constriction	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbyssalHarvesterRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:An abyssal harvester that has successfully grappled an opponent of its size or smaller deals tentacle damage plus 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the hold is maintained. A creature reduced to Constitution 0 by an abyssal harvester dies. Note, that the abyssal harvester only deals Constitution damage when constricting a foe.
Far Reaching			KEY:Abyssal Harvester ~ Far Reaching			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbyssalHarvesterRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:An abyssal harvester can remain on its abyssal plane and inject up to four of its tentacles across the dimensions and into the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, material planes, or Nine Hells. It can do this a total of twelve times per day (so it could inject one tentacle twelve times into any plane, or four tentacles up to three times each).  All of its tentacles must be injected into the same plane, and all appear within the same 20-foot area. While using this abitliy, it uses sensory organs on its tentacles to see, hear, smell, and feel its surroundings. It can attack normally (at its full attack bonus) while using this ability but it cannot move from its current location. It can withdraw its tentacles as a move action and re-inject them into the same plane (or a different plane) on its next turn.  A dismissal, dispel chaos, or dispel evil spell (using the second effect of either spell) causes an abyssal harvester to withdraw a single tentacle (whichever one was touched) if it fails its Will save.  It cannot re-inject that same tentacle into the same plane for one day.  A banishment spell forces an abyssal harvester to withdraw all of its tentacles if it fails its Will save. It cannot re-inject any tentacles that were banished into the same plane for one day.
Harvest				KEY:Abyssal Harvester ~ Harvest				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbyssalHarvesterRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:This ability can only be used when the abyssal harvester is on its abyssal plane and injects its tentacles into the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, a material plane, or the Nine Hells.  A grappled foe with 20 or fewer hit points or 4 or fewer Constitution points must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or be drawn through an invisible planar gate (created around the abyssal harvester's tentacles) onto the same plane where the abyssal harvester currently resides. An opponent drawn into the same plane with the harvester is still grappled upon arrival. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Tentacle Regeneration		KEY:Abyssal Harvester ~ Tentacle Regeneration		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbyssalHarvesterRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:An abyssal harvester regrows any lost tentacles in 1 week.
Aligned Weapons			KEY:Abyssal Harvester ~ Aligned Weapons			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbyssalHarvesterRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:An abyssal harvester's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

The adherer automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack.  Opponents so grappled cannot break free while the adherer is alive without removing the adhesive first.  A weapon that strikes an adherer is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC %1 Reflex save. A successful DC %1 Strength check is needed to pry it off.  The save and check DC are both Constitution-based.  An application of boiling water thrown on the adherer deals 1d4 points of damage to it (and to any creature stuck to it). It also reduces both the Reflex save DC and the Strength check DC to 10 for 1 round. An application of fire deals damage to both the adherer and any creature stuck to it and weakens the adhesive (as above) for 1d3 rounds.
